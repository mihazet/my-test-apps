                      Aardvark I2C/SPI Software
                      -------------------------

Introduction
------------
This document outlines the changes required to upgrade existing
software that is dependent on previous versions of the API.  Only
the changes between versions are given in the sections below.  New
features are addressed in the datasheet.

Please ensure that all older copies of the Aardvark library
(aardvark.dll or aardvark.so) are removed from your operating system
path before running your upgraded application.  This will help
prevent the wrong library from being loaded with your application,
thereby causing a version mismatch.


Upgrade from v3.30 to v4.00
---------------------------
- Changes to naming convention of certain types.  For example,
  AA_STATUS is now AardvarkStatus.

- Older Numeric type definitions with the "aa_" prefix are now
  deprecated.  For example, "u16" should be used in lieu of
  "aa_u16".


Upgrade from v2.50 to v3.00
---------------------------
- Changes to the parameter order of the following functions:

     int aa_find_devices (
         int      nmemb,
         aa_u16 * array
     );

     int aa_i2c_read (
         Aardvark     aardvark,
         aa_u16       slave_addr,
         AA_I2C_FLAGS flags,
         aa_u16       num_bytes,
         aa_u08 *     data_in
     );

     int aa_i2c_write (
         Aardvark       aardvark,
         aa_u16         slave_addr,
         AA_I2C_FLAGS   flags,
         aa_u16         num_bytes,
         const aa_u08 * data_out
     );

- Structure AA_VERSION has been changed to AardvarkVersion

- aa_log() takes a file descriptor instead of a FILE * stream

- Direct USB driver on both Windows and Linux eliminates any
  association with virtual USB serial ports

- Visual Basic, Python, Labview no longer require a separate DLL


Upgrade from v2.00 to v2.50
---------------------------
- No user-visible changes to the API
